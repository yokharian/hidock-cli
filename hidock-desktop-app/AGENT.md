# HiDock Desktop App

## Overview

The HiDock Desktop App is a Python-based GUI application for managing audio recordings from HiDock devices. This document outlines the mandatory standards and procedures for its development. Adherence to these rules is not optional.

## Initial Setup

A compliant development environment is critical for maintaining code quality and consistency. Follow these steps once to prepare your local environment.

The `requirements.txt` file must be updated with any new dependencies.

## Development Workflow

**IMPORTANT: Before running any command, ensure the virtual environment is activated.** You will see `(.venv)` at the beginning of your shell prompt.

### Running the Application

1. **Activate:** Activate the new environment.

   ```bash
   # Activate on Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   # Activate on macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. To run the application for development or testing:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Code Style

A consistent code style is enforced to ensure readability and maintainability.

- **Tooling:** The project uses **Ruff** for both linting and formatting.
- **Line Limit:** Code lines must not exceed **100 characters**.
- **Naming Conventions:** For acronyms in variable names, use uppercase (e.g., `api_client`, `user_id`).
- **Docstrings:** All public modules, classes, and functions must have a docstring explaining their purpose and usage.
- **Error Handling:** Do not use broad, silent exception handling. `except Exception:` must be used sparingly and should always log the error. Never use `except Exception: pass`.

### Quality Assurance: Linting, Formatting, and Testing

These checks must pass before any code is submitted.

1. **Code Style & Formatting:**

   ```bash
   # Check for linting errors
   ruff check .
   # Automatically format all files
   ruff format .
   ```

2. **Testing:** The project uses **pytest**. All tests are in the `tests/` directory.

   - Test names must be descriptive and omit the word "should" (e.g., `test_validates_input`, not `test_should_validate_input`).
   - All new features must be accompanied by corresponding tests. Code coverage must not decrease.

   ```bash
   # Run the full test suite
   pytest
   # Run tests with a coverage report
   pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

## Architecture

The application employs a modular architecture based on the principle of separation of concerns.

- `main.py`: Application entry point.
- `gui_*.py`: Presentation layer. Must only contain UI logic and delegate business logic.
- `*_module.py` / `*_manager.py`: Core business logic. Must be UI-agnostic.
- `device_interface.py`: Sole module for direct hardware communication.
- `constants.py`: Holds all static, project-wide constant values.

## Security

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Code should only have the permissions necessary to perform its function.
- **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan for vulnerabilities with **pip-audit**. Any discovered vulnerabilities must be addressed immediately.

  ```bash
  pip-audit
  ```

- **API Key Management:** Secrets must be loaded from `hidock_config.json` or environment variables and never hardcoded.
- **Input Validation:** All data from external sources (UI, files, device) must be rigorously validated.

## Git Workflow

A standardized Git workflow is enforced to maintain a clean history.

1. **Pre-Commit Check:** Before committing, **ALWAYS** run the full quality suite. It must pass without errors.

   ```bash
   ruff check . && ruff format . && pytest
   ```

2. **Branching:** All work must be on a feature branch, named `feature/descriptive-name`.
3. **Commits:** Commit messages must follow the **Conventional Commits** specification.
4. **Pushing:** Never use `git push --force`. If a force-push is necessary on a feature branch, **ALWAYS** use `git push --force-with-lease`.
5. **Pull Requests (PRs):**
   - A PR must be created to merge into `main`.
   - The PR description must clearly explain the "what" and "why."
   - PRs require one review and must pass all CI checks before merging.
6. **Merging:** Use "Squash and Merge." Delete the feature branch after merging.

## Configuration

When adding a new configuration option:

1. Add the new key and a default value to `hidock_config.json`.
2. Update any related documentation to explain the new setting.
3. Ensure the application handles the absence of the new key gracefully.
