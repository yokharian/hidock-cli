"""
Main entry point for the HiDock Tool application.


This script initializes and runs the main graphical user interface (GUI)
for the HiDock Tool, built using customtkinter. It sets up initial
appearance modes and themes for the GUI.

The script includes a top-level exception handler that logs critical errors
and attempts to display a user-friendly error message using tkinter
as a fallback if the main customtkinter application fails to initialize
or encounters a severe runtime issue.
