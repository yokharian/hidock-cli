"""
Global Constants for the HiDock Tool Application.


This module defines various constant values used across the HiDock tool,
including USB device identifiers, communication protocol command IDs,
endpoint addresses, and the name of the configuration file.
Centralizing these constants helps in maintaining consistency and
ease of modification.
